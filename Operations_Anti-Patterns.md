## Chapter 1: DevOps ingredients.


## Chapter 2: The paternalist syndrome.

## Chapter 3. Operational blindness.

- Despite all the graphs, chars and alerts the team members had around system metrics, they were any closer to understanding when their system was misbehaving.
- With every company essentially being a software company, the applications that operations teams support are no longer just secondary, internal-use applications. In many organizations, these applications are revenue drivers and are core to the company's ability to make a profit. With that shift from internal tools to revenue generation, the pressure to have a deeper understanding of the applications being supported is becoming stronger and stronger.
- As systems grow and become increasingly more complex, the idea of full and thorough testing in a preproduction environment is becoming less viable.
- Understanding the product you're supporting leads to a better understanding of the types of metrics that you need to generate an monitor in order to verify that your system is functioning as expected.
- The operations team's ability to respond to anomalies is dependent on the knowledge of what normal is. This Knowledge will come only from an understanding of the product and observation of the product over time.
- Operational visibility: metrics and logs. A ***metric*** is a measurement at a point in time of a system resource. ***Logs***, on the other hand, are system-generated messages that describe an event that occurred in the system.
- When youâ€™re working with a system, three characteristics about the work that the system is doing are almost universally useful: 
  - ***Throughput*** is defined as the amount of work flowing through your system at any given time.
  - **Error counts** are a metric that most engineers are familiar with. It tallies the number of errors that have happened since a process or system has started.
  - **Error rates** are a calculation on error count and are represented as a percentage of the total number of requests. To calculate the error rate, you take the number of failed work units and divide it by the total number of work units.
  - ***Latency*** is a measurement of how long it takes a particular action to occur.
- Creating ***custom metrics*** is a must in order to bring greater operational visibility to your application.
